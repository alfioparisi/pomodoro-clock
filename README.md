#Pomodoro Clock

There are six steps in the technique:
* Decide on the task to be done.
* Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).
* Work on the task until the timer rings.
* After the timer rings, put a checkmark.
* If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes), then go to step 2.
* After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.
